# AI-Powered Network Defense System Mini-Project

## 🛡️ Project Overview

This mini-project implements an advanced AI-powered network defense system designed to enhance cybersecurity through intelligent threat detection, analysis, and mitigation strategies.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Intelligent Threat Detection**: Leverages machine learning algorithms to identify potential network security threats
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous network traffic analysis
- **Automated Response**: Proactive threat mitigation mechanisms
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed security event tracking

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python Package Manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdabhinavkarthik/ai-network-defense.git
   cd ai-network-defense
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
Running the Network Defense System

python main.py

Configuration
Modify config.yaml to customize:

Network interfaces
Threat detection sensitivity
Logging preferences

📊 Components
main.py: Primary application entry point
threat_detector.py: AI-powered threat detection module
network_monitor.py: Network traffic monitoring
response_engine.py: Automated threat response mechanisms

🔬 How It Works
Network Monitoring: Continuously captures and analyzes network traffic
Threat Detection: Machine learning models identify potential security risks
Automated Response: Implements predefined mitigation strategies
Logging: Records all detected threats and system actions
🛠️ Development

**Running Tests**
